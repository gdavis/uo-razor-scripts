# What does @ do?
# If you prefix a command with the
# @ this will silence any 
# warning/output from the command. 
# For example:
    
// Generate warning if robe is out of reach
lifttype 'robe'

// Silence warning if robe is out of reach
@lifttype 'robe'


# What does setvar! do?
# This will make a variable only
# be defined in the local scope.

# sets a variable that exists
# until Razor is terminated
setvar! runtimeVar 0

# if both @ and ! are used, 
# the variable only exists
# until the scrip is finished.
@setvar! localVar 0


# In game tip:
# use >hotkeys for all bound
# keys/scripts
